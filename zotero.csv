However, some research works show that the new product’s perceived cues can better explain its adoption than individual characteristics. Our work lies in the latter perspective and contributes to explain cognitive and sensory mechanisms of adoption, making a careful distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic effects of new product cues. Moreover, most research works use unique and immediate measurements while it appears necessary to make repeated measurements. Therefore, we implement longitudinal methodologies in this research. Three experimentations show lower quality expectations with the modified non-sensory cue (reduced alcohol content) than with the usual non-sensory cue (normal alcohol content). However, perception of this non-sensory information on modification is not sufficiently negative to reduce the overall perceived quality of the new product which remains close to that of the regular product. Therefore, both judging by its taste and conceptually, a new food product (i.e. low-alcohol wine) seems acceptable, at least as long as it does not move away too far from limits of the products category to which it belongs.","","2025-03-10 10:29:56","2025-03-10 10:29:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fr","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/camillejeanningros/Zotero/storage/ICT49W5I/Masson - EFFETS DE LA MODIFICATION D’UN ATTRIBUT CONSTITUTIF D’UN PRODUIT ALIMENTAIRE SUR SON ADOPTION PAR LE.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate plays a vital role in the terroir of a given wine region, as it strongly controls canopy microclimate, vine growth, vine physiology, yield, and berry composition, which together determine wine attributes and typicity. New challenges are, however, predicted to arise from climate change, as grapevine cultivation is deeply dependent on weather and climate conditions. Changes in viticultural suitability over the last decades, for viticulture in general or the use of speciﬁc varieties, have already been reported for many wine regions. Despite spatially heterogeneous impacts, climate change is anticipated to exacerbate these recent trends on suitability for wine production. These shifts may reshape the geographical distribution of wine regions, while wine typicity may also be threatened in most cases. Changing climates will thereby urge for the implementation of timely, suitable, and cost-eﬀective adaptation strategies, which should also be thoroughly planned and tuned to local conditions for an eﬀective risk reduction. Although the potential of the diﬀerent adaptation options is not yet fully investigated, deserving further research activities, their adoption will be of utmost relevance to maintain the socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the highly valued viticulture and winemaking sector in Europe.","2020-04-29","2025-03-10 10:30:27","2025-03-10 10:30:27","2025-03-10 10:30:27","3092","","9","10","","Applied Sciences","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/camillejeanningros/Zotero/storage/DUMRJRVZ/Santos et al. - 2020 - A Review of the Potential Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Options for European Viticulture.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adaptation to these challenges is essential to guarantee the sustainability of viticulture. The aim of this review is to present adaptation possibilities from the soil-hidden, and often disregarded, part of the grapevine, the roots. The complexity of soil–root interactions makes necessary a comprehensive approach taking into account physiology, pathology and genetics, in order to outline strategies to improve viticulture adaptation to current and future threats. Rootstocks are the link between soil and scion in grafted crops, and they have played an essential role in viticulture since the introduction of phylloxera into Europe at the end of the 19th century. This review outlines current and future challenges that are threatening the sustainability of the wine sector and the relevant role that rootstocks can play to face these threats. We describe how rootstocks along with soil management can be exploited as an essential tool to deal with the effects of climate change and of emerging soil-borne pests and pathogens. Moreover, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of diverse genetic strategies for rootstock breeding.","2021-01","2025-03-10 10:30:42","2025-03-10 10:30:42","2025-03-10 10:30:42","8-25","","1","27","","Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research","Challenges of viticulture adaptation to global change","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/camillejeanningros/Zotero/storage/5JV6SI3A/Marín et al. - 2021 - Challenges of viticulture adaptation to global change tackling the issue from the roots.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
